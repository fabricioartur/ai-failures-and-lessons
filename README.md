# AI Failures and Lessons Learned

This repository documents **recurring failure patterns**
observed during AI adoption initiatives.

No blame.  
No names.  
Only lessons.

## Why this exists

Most AI failures are not technical.

They are caused by:
- unclear ownership
- poor integration decisions
- unrealistic expectations
- missing operational thinking

---

## Recurrent failure patterns

- Treating AI as a standalone feature
- Deploying without clear success metrics
- Ignoring latency and cost constraints
- Over-architecting before validation
- Lack of rollback and incident planning

---

## What usually happens

- POCs succeed, production fails
- Demos impress, systems degrade
- Costs explode silently
- Teams lose trust in AI initiatives

---

## Purpose

This repository exists to help teams **avoid repeating the same mistakes**.

Experience is expensive.  
Learning from others should not be.
